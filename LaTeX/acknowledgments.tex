We are sincerely thankful to these dear mentors of ours. These individuals have
taught us the required mathematics to perform a study of this grade, while at
the same time inspiring us to seek our potential. \\

\begin{center}
  \emph{A thank you to:} \\
\end{center}

\textbf{Björn Norén} for teaching us advanced mathematics and to always look
after our health. The removal of the chocolate from our coffees have made us
considerably more manly. We inform you that the chest
hair has grown considerably during the span of this course. \\

\textbf{Jonas Ingesson} for making the subject entertaining in a comedic way, an
excellent way to engrave hard-to-memorise topics. We appreciate that you take
care of your magnificent sheep instead of correcting our exams
that our lives depend on. \\

\textbf{Belal Tulimat} for always pushing us to our highest level, giving us
challenge after challenge to ascend our brains to the heavens. By taking our
pens and showing insane solutions our brains have been infused with the ultimate
calculus of doom. \\

Last but not least, \textbf{Bertil Nilsson}, the great Professor at Halmstad
Högskola that have taught us that computers have the potential to solve
every mathematical problem in blink of an eye. We thank you for many Mathematica-induced headaches.\\
