We are sincerely thankful to these dear mentors of ours. These individuals have
taught us the required mathematics to perform a study of this grade, while at
the same time inspiring us to seek our potential. \\

\begin{center}
  \emph{A thank you to:} \\
\end{center}

\textbf{Björn Norén} for teaching us advanced mathematics and to always
look after our health. Thank you for forcing us to become more manly by
forcefully removing the chocolate from our coffees. We inform you that the chest
hair has grown considerably during the span of this course.\\

\textbf{Jonas Ingesson} for making the subject entertaining in a
comedic way, an excellent way to engrave hard-to-memorise topics. We appreciate
that you take care of your magnificent sheep instead of correcting our exams
that our lives depend on.\\

\textbf{Belal Tulimat} for always pushing us to our highest level, giving us
challenge after challenge to ascend our brain power. Also for taking our pens
and infusing our brains with the ultimate calculus of doom. \\

And of course last but not least, \textbf{Bertil Nilsson}, the great University
professor that taught us that computers have the potential to
solve every mathematical problem we can solve in a blink of an eye. We thank you
for many mathematica-induced headaches.\\
