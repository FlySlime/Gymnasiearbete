We are sincerely thankful to these dear mentors of ours. These individuals have
taught us the required mathematics to perform a study of this grade, while at
the same time inspiring us to seek our potential. \\

\emph{A thank you to:} \\

\textbf{Björn Norén} for teaching us advanced mathematics and to always
look after our health. \\

\textbf{Jonas Ingensson} for making the subject entertaining in a
comedic way, an excellent way to engrave hard-to-memorise topics. \\

\textbf{Belal Tulimat} for always pushing us to our highest level, giving us
challenge after challenge to ascend our brain power. \\

And of course last but not least, \textbf{Bertil Nilsson}, the great University
professor that taught us that computers have the potential to
solve every mathematical problem we can solve in a blink of an eye. \\
