Belal Tulimat
The man, the myth, the legend. Our very own private teacher. With your special ability to steal pens from our hands, you have taught us everything we need and don't need to know about hyperbolas, integrals and the Corona virus. 

Loke Gustafsson
The one and only Loke. There is no word in the English dictionary that can describe you, so the only correct word would be "Lokeism". The fact that the you thought our work was good, really gave us the motivation to continue.

Björn Norén
Our favourite bald-headed teacher that gave us way too high grades in physical education. This was the only reason we chose this class. If we were able to get too high grades in PE, why wouldn't we be able to succeed in math?

Fredrik Larvall

Christiane Miller
Arguably the most warm-hearted teacher on earth. You always do your best for your students.
