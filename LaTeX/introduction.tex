\subsection{History}
Prime numbers have been studied since Ancient Greece, and have, perhaps, been
known to us for even longer. \cite{prime} Add more information

\subsection{Aim}
The purpose of this essay is to study how large prime number are found.
Investigating all the aspects of prime numbers would be a near impossible task;
therefore, this essay will focus more on learning about the methods and
algorithms of finding new primes. The study will also present ways to prove that
a given number, $n$, is indeed prime. \newline
\\*
The relevant questions for this study are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What methods can be used to find new primes?
\item What are some algorithms for primality testing?
\item Which algorithm is the most efficient and why?
\end{enumerate}
