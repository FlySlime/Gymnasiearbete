\subsection{History}
Prime numbers have been studied since Ancient Greece, and have, perhaps, been known to us for even longer. \cite{prime}

\subsection{Aim}
The purpose of this essay is to study how large prime number are found. Investigating all the aspects of prime numbers would be a near impossible task; therefore, this essay will focus more on learning about the methods and algorithms of finding new primes. The study will also present ways to prove that a given number, $n$, is indeed prime. Primes are without a doubt beautiful mathematically, but what real life application do primes have?
\newline
\\*
The relevant questions for this study are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What methods can be used to find new primes?
    \item What are some algorithms for primality testing?
    \item Are there "accurate" ways to measure the amount of primes under a given number, $N$?
    \item Which algorithm is the most efficient and why?
\end{enumerate}
