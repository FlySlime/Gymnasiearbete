The results showed that in 4.1, the fastest algorithm was the Fermat algorithm,
and in 4.2, the fastest one was Lucas-Lehmer. Drawing good conclusions from
these results is not possible because of the method flaws, such as not testing
different values of $k$ and having too few test cases.

Even though a good conclusion cannot be drawn, this study still accomplishes its
goal, namely to give us an introduction to applied programming, number theory
and writing scientifically. This study could also be used as an introduction to
said subjects, for other people our ages.
