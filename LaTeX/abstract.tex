Prime numbers are a fundamental part of number theory. They have many important
properties and it is therefore of some number theorists interests to find larger
and larger primes. In order to accomplish this, efficient algorithms have to be
developed. This study investigates the efficiency of five common primality
testing algorithms: Brute-force, Smart Brute-force, Lucas-Lehmer, Fermat and
Miller-Rabin. Two different tests were performed to compare the algorithms. \\

In the first test, the algorithms were given the task of finding the largest
prime number within $60$ seconds by looping the natural numbers from $2$. The
first test could not include Lucas-Lehmer, as it only works for mersenne numbers. \\

In the second test, the algorithms were given mersenne primes of different sizes
and returned the time it took for them to finish verifying that it was indeed a
prime. However, if the time exceeded $120$ seconds, the test case would be
deemed as a ``failure'' and immediately end the program. These tests showed that
the Fermat primality test was the fastest algorithm to find primes, albeit probabilistic. \\

This study has little to no use in actually finding new primes, as much more
efficient algorithms are currently used for this purpose. However, this study
can be used to demonstrate the correlation between the big O notation and
runtimes, as-well as giving an introduction to primality testing algorithms. \\
